# High-Resolution-Prediction
In this paper, we present the methodology to construct spatiotemporal high-resolution maps. We combine low-resolution spatiotemporal area-level (districts) data on population at risk and incidence and high-resolution cell-level data on weather variables to obtain predictions of relative risk at subdistrict level.
